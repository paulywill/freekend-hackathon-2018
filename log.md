### Day 1 of 4: February 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
Day one of the first Freekend Hackathon of 2018 (and perhaps the only one of 2018).

After some frustrating troubleshooting with trying to fire up the old RoR POS project, I decide it would probably be more productive to start from scratch again and reference the old code as needed.

Following the Getting Started Guide I'm just tweaking the form to Packjobs instead of Articles. Nothing mind bending.

**Thoughts**:
This weekend project will be very basic but hopefully will demonstrate to my friend what he needs.

Hopefully I will be able to host it online and let me test it out over the season.

### Day 2 of 4: February 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**:

Got a little bit farther through the Getting Started Guide.

Learned a little about 'Strong Parameters'.
**Thoughts**:

Slow progress. There's a difference between flying through a tutorial and guide and then reading and understanding.

I'm truly hoping this will be running decent by the end of the weekend.

I'm going to regret not going to bed earlier.
