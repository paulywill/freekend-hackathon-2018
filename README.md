My family is away for the weekend and I have four days to myself. Therefore I will  I am coding up a small web application for a friend this weekend.

The application will be used as a POS for a local drop zone created using Ruby on Rails.

I made a similar one a number of years, but alas it has become dusty and no longer complying with new conventions.

By the end of the weekend I hope to have a running prototype to show him and eventually host it online.
